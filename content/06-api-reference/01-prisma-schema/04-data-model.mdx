## Overview

The data model definition defines your _application models_ (also called _Prisma models_). These models represent the _entities of your application domain_ and map to the _tables_ in your database.

Models are the foundation for all available queries in the [Prisma Client API](../prisma-client/api). When used with TypeScript, Prisma Client provides generated type definitions for your models and any [variations](../prisma-client/advanced-usage-of-generated-types) of them to make database access entirely type safe.

### Application domain examples

A few examples for application domains and "typical" models are:

- In a **blogging** application you probably have models like `Blog`, `Author`, `Article` and `Comment`.
- In an **e-commerce** application you probably have models like `Customer`, `Order`, `Item` and `Invoice`.
- In a **social media** application you probably have models like `User`, `Post`, `Photo` and `Message`.

### Technical purpose of Prisma models

On a _technical_ level, models serve two main purposes:

- They represent the tables in the underlying database.
- They are the foundation for the available queries in the generated [Prisma Client API](../prisma-client/api).

### Data modeling primitives

You can create your data model using the following primitives:

- `model`: Defines a [Prisma model](models)
- `enum`: Defines an [enum](#enums) (only available if enums are supported natively by your database)

Additionally, you can configure your models with [attributes](#attributes) and [functions](#functions).

## Example

```prisma
datasource postgresql {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  role    Role     @default(USER)
  posts   Post[]
  profile Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id      Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  bio     String
  user    User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId  Int
}

model Post {
  id         Int         @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt  DateTime    @default(now())
  title      String
  published  Boolean     @default(false)
  author     User        @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId   Int
  categories Category[]  @relation(references: [id])
}

model Category {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  posts Post[]  @relation(references: [id])
}

enum Role {
  USER
  ADMIN
}
```

## Introspection vs Prisma Migrate

Depending on the use case, the data model is typically created in either of two ways:

- **Manually written**: You can write your data model manually and map it to your database using [Prisma Migrate](../prisma-migrate) (experimental). In this case, the data model is the single source of truth for the models of your application.
- **Generated from introspection**: When you have an existing database or prefer migrating your database schema with SQL, you generate the data model by [introspecting](../introspection) your database. In this case, the database schema is the single source of truth for the models of your application.

> **Note**: Since Prisma Migrate is currently in an experimental state, the officially recommended way for using Prisma is the introspection-based approach.

## Models

You can find information about models [here](models).

## Enums

You can define enums in your data model if they're supported by the [data source](data-sources) you use:

- PostgreSQL: [Supported](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/datatype-enum.html)
- MySQL: [Supported](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/enum.html)
- SQLite: Not supported

Enums are considered [scalar](#scalar-types) types in the Prisma data model. They're therefore [by default](../prisma-client/field-selection#the-default-selection-set) included as return values in [Prisma Client queries](../prisma-client/crud).

Enums are defined via the `enum` block.

## Attributes

Attributes modify the behavior of a [field](models#fields) or block (e.g. [models](models)). There are two ways to add attributes to your data model:

- _Field_ attributes are prefixed with `@`
- _Block_ attributes are prefixed with `@@`

### Overview

Here's a quick overview of the available field attributes:

### IDs

You can add IDs to your models to be able to uniquely identify individual records of that model. In relational databases, this ID corresponds to a `PRIMARY KEY` constraint.

IDs can be defined on a **single field** using `@id` or on **multiple fields** (also called composite or compound IDs) using `@@id`. Any model can at most have one ID, no matter if it's defined on a single field or on multiple fields.

#### Single-field IDs

To determine which field of a model represents the ID, you can annotate it with the `@id` attribute. Note that a field that's annotated with `@id` can not be [optional](models#optional-vs-required).

`@id` attributes can be defined on fields of any [type](models#field-types) in your Prisma schema (e.g. `Int`, `String`, enums, relation fields, ...). The only exception are "virtual" [relation fields](relations#relation-fields) that are defined only on a Prisma-level but do not manifest in the database.

#### Multi-field IDs

To determine which fields of a model represent the multi-field ID, you can include them in the `@@id` attribute that's defined on your model.

`@@id` attributes can include fields of any [type](models#field-types) in your Prisma schema (e.g. `Int`, `String`, enums, relation fields, ...).

### Unique values

You can add unique attributes to your models to be able to uniquely identify individual records of that model. In relational databases, this corresponds to adding a `UNIQUE` constraint.

Unique attributes can be defined on a **single field** using `@unique` or on **multiple fields** (also called composite or compound unique constraints) using `@@unique`. A model can have any number of unique attributes.

> **Note**: Adding a unique constraint automatically adds a corresponding _unique index_ to the specified column(s).

#### Single-field unique attributes

To add a unique attribute to a field of a model, you can annotate it with the `@unique` attribute. A field that's annotated with `@unique` can be [optional or required](models#optional-vs-required). If the field is optional, `null` values are always considered to be distinct from each other and any other values.

The only exception where a field annotated with `@unique` _must_ be required is when it is the only unique constraint on a model that has no ID:

```prisma
model User {
  email String  @unique // `email` can not be optional because it's the only unique field on the model
  name  String?
}
```

`@unique` attributes can be defined on fields of any [type](models#field-types) in your Prisma schema (e.g. `Int`, `String`, enums, relation fields, ...). The only exception are "virtual" [relation fields](relations#relation-fields) that are defined only on a Prisma-level but do not manifest in the database.

##### Examples

Note that in this case, it is _allowed_ to have multiple `User` records in the database where the `email` is `NULL` because `NULL` values are considered to distinct from each other.

#### Multi-field unique attributes

To add multi-field unique attribue to a model, you have to annotate it with the `@@unique` attribute and provide the list of referenced fields as an argument.

`@@unique` attributes can include fields of any [type](models#field-types) in your Prisma schema (e.g. `Int`, `String`, enums, relation fields, ...).

### Default values

You can define default values for the fields of your models using the `@default` attribute. `@default` attributes are typically represented by `DEFAULT` values in the underlying database (with a few exceptions like `cuid()` and `uuid()` which are provided by Prisma's [query engine](../prisma-client/query-engine) and are therefore not "visible" in the underlying database schema).

The `@default` attribute takes as argument an _expression_, this can be a static, hardcoded value e.g. `5`, `true`, `"Hello"` or a function, e.g. `now()`, `uuid()`, `cuid()`. Note that there is a special function in the Prisma schema called `dbgenerated()` which is used in [introspection](../introspection) results for default values that can not yet be represented in the Prisma schema.

Default values can be defined on any scalar type but not on relation fields.

#### Static default values

For [scalar types](#scalar-types), you can use any static value that corresponds to the type of a field as a default value:

| Type       | Examples                         |
| :--------- | :------------------------------- |
| `Int`      | `-100`, `0`, `42`                |
| `Float`    | `-100.5`, `0`, `4.2`             |
| `String`   | `"Alice"`, `"Hello World"`, `""` |
| `Boolean`  | `true`, `false`                  |
| `DateTime` | `"2020-03-19T14:21:00+0200"`     |

Note that static default values for `DateTime` are based on the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard. However, they must always include the time including the [time offsets from UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_offsets_from_UTC).

Similarly, you can define default values for [enums](#enums). Assume you have the following enum definition:

```prisma
enum Role {
  USER
  ADMIN
}
```

In that case, you have two possible values as default values:

| Type   | Examples            |
| :----- | :------------------ |
| `Role` | `ADMIN`, `CUSTOMER` |

#### Functions as default values

These are the available functions and the types they're compatible with:

| Function          | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| :---------------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `autoincrement()` | `Int`      | Create a sequence of integers in the underlying database and assign the incremented values to the ID values of the created records based on the sequence. |
| `now()`           | `DateTime` | Set a timestamp of the time when a record is created.                                                                                                     |
| `cuid()`          | `String`   | Generate a globally unique identifier based on the [`cuid`](https://github.com/ericelliott/cuid) spec.                                                    |
| `uuid()`          | `String`   | Generate a globally unique identifier based on the [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) spec.                              |
| `dbgenerated()`   | Any        | Represents default values that can't be expressed in the Prisma schema. Only available after [introspection](../introspection).                           |

Note that using these functions will have different effects with respect to your database and Prisma internals:

| Function          | PostgreSQL                                                                                                                                 | MySQL                                                                                                                                           | SQLite                                                                  | Prisma                                                       |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cuid()`          | n/a                                                                                                                                        | n/a                                                                                                                                             | n/a                                                                     | Implemented by [query engine](../prisma-client/query-engine) |
| `uuid()`          | n/a                                                                                                                                        | n/a                                                                                                                                             | n/a                                                                     | Implemented by [query engine](../prisma-client/query-engine) |
| `autoincrement()` | Uses the [`SERIAL`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/datatype-numeric.html#DATATYPE-SERIAL) type                                        | Uses the [`AUTO_INCREMENT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/example-auto-increment.html) attribute                                      | Uses the [`AUTOINCREMENT`](https://www.sqlite.org/autoinc.html) keyword | n/a                                                          |
| `now()`           | [`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-CURRENT) and aliases like `now()` | [`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_current-timestamp) and aliases like `now()` | `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` and aliases like `date('now')`                      |
| `dbgenerated()`   | Any expression                                                                                                                             | Any expression                                                                                                                                  | Any expression                                                          | n/a                                                          |

`autoincrement()`, `now` and `dbgenerated()` on the other hand are always "implemented" on the database-level, meaning they manifest in the database schema and can be recognized through introspection.

#### Limitations

Default values are currently not allowed on relation fields in the Prisma schema. Note however that you can still define default values _manually_ in the underlying database using plain SQL. These will not be represented in the Prisma schema though, this is a temporary limitation which you can [track on GitHub](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/1111).

### Indexes

You can define indexes on one or multiple fields of your models via the `@@index` on a model.

### Mapping column, table and enum names

You can use the `@map` and `@@map` attributes to map field, model and enum names as well in your Prisma schema to different column and table names in the underlying database schema.

Read more about this on the [Configuring the Prisma Client API](../prisma-client/configuring-the-prisma-client-api) page.

### Configuring relations

You can learn everything about configuration relations on the [Relations](relations) page in the docs.

## Functions

The Prisma schema supports a number of functions. These can be used to specify [default values](#default-values) on fields of a model. You can find a reference for all available functions [here](#functions-as-default-values).
