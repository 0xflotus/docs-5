## Overview

A data source can be specified using a `datasource` block in the Prisma schema file.

When running a Prisma CLI command that needs the database connection URL (e.g. `prisma generate`), you need to make sure that the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set.

One way to do so is by creating a [`.env`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) file with the following contents. Note that the file must be in the same directory as your `schema.prisma` file to automatically picked up the Prisma CLI.

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://johndoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public
```
