## Overview

A generator can be specified via the `generator` block in the Prisma schema. Generators in your Prisma schema specify what assets are generated when the `prisma generate` command is invoked.

## Binary targets

Prisma relies on several [engine binaries](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines). For example, Prisma Client uses the [query engine binary file](../prisma-client/query-engine) under the hood to communicate with a database. Prisma Migrate uses the migration engine binary file to run schema migrations against a database.

These _engines_ are implemented in Rust and are used by Prisma in the form of executable _binary files_.

Being aware of the binary file is especially important when [deploying](../prisma-client/deployment) your application to production!

> **Note**: You can learn more about binary targets in the [spec](https://github.com/prisma/specs/blob/master/binaries/Readme.md).

#### The native binary target

The `native` binary target is special. It doesn't map to a concrete operating system. Instead, when `native` is specified in `binaryTargets`, Prisma detects the _current_ operating system and automatically specifies the correct binary target for it.

As an example, assume you're running **Mac OS** and you specify the following generator:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["native"]
}
```

In that case, Prisma detects your operating system and finds the right binary file for it based on the table [above](#supported-operating-systems). As you're running Mac OS, the binary file that was compiled for `darwin` will be selected.
