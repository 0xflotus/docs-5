## Overview

This page gives a high-level overview of what Prisma is and how it works. If you have want to learn more about the motivation of Prisma, check out the [Why Prisma?](./why-prisma) page.

## What

Prisma is an [open source]() database toolkit. It mainly consists of the following parts:

- **Prisma Client**: An auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js and TypeScript.
- **Prisma Migrate** (experimental): A declarative schema migration system.
- **Prisma Studio** (experimental): A GUI to view and edit data in your database.

Prisma Client can be used in _any_ Node.js or TypeScript application. This can be a [REST API](), a [GraphQL API]() a gRPC API or anything else that needs a database.

Every project that uses Prisma is further based on a [Prisma schema file]() which contains your database connection, client generators and a representation of your database schema as a delarative Prisma [data model]().

## How

Prisma offers two main workflows which depend on _how_ you're performing _schema migrations_ (e.g.adding new or altering existing tables):

- **SQL migrations and introspection** (recommended)
- **Prisma Migrate** (experimental)

> **Note** As long as Prisma Migrate is in an experimental state, the recommended way for using Prisma is with SQL migrations and introspection. Note that you can still use Prisma Migrate in non-critical applications.

The typical workflow when using SQL migrations and introspection looks as follows:

1. Manually adjust your database schema using SQL
1. (Re-)introspect your database
1. (Re-)generate Prisma Client
1. Use Prisma Client in your application code to access your database

With Prisma Migrate, the workflow looks slightly different:

1. Manually adjust your [Prisma data model]()
1. Migrate your database using the `prisma migrate` CLI commands
1. (Re-)generate Prisma Client
1. Use Prisma Client in your application code to access your database
