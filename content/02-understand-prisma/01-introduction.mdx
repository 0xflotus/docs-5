## Overview

This page gives a high-level overview of what Prisma is and how it works. 

If you want to get started with a _practical introduction_ and learn about the Prisma Client API, head over to the [Quickstart](). 

To learn more about the _motivation_ for Prisma, check out the [Why Prisma?](./why-prisma) page.

## What is Prisma?

Prisma is an [open source]() database toolkit. It mainly consists of the following parts:

- **Prisma Client**: Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & TypeScript
- **Prisma Migrate** (_experimental_): Declarative schema migration system
- **Prisma Studio** (_experimental_): GUI to view and edit data in your database

Prisma Client can be used in _any_ Node.js or TypeScript backend application. This can be a [REST API](), a [GraphQL API]() a gRPC API or anything else that needs a database.

## How does Prisma work?

### The Prisma schema

Every project that use a tool from the Prisma toolkit starts with a [Prisma schema file](). The Prisma schema allows developers to define their _application models_ in an intuitive data modeling language. It also contains the connection to a database and defines a _generator_:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)
  author    User?
}

model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
  posts Post[]
}
```

> **Note**: The Prisma schema has powerful data modeling features. For example, it allows you to define [virtual relation fields]() which will make it easier to work with [relations in the Prisma Client API](). In the case above, the `posts` field on `User` is virtual.

In this schema, you configure three things:

- **Data source**: Specifies your database connection (via an environment variable)
- **Generator**: Indicates that you want to genenerate Prisma Client
- **Data model**: Defines your application models

### The Prisma data model

On this page, the focus is on the data model. You can learn more about [Data sources]() and [Generators]() on the respective docs pages.

#### Functions of Prisma models

The data model is a collection of [models](). A model has two major functions:

- Map to a table in the underlying database
- Provide the foundation for the queries in the Prisma Client API

#### Getting a data model

There are two major workflows for "getting" a data model into your Prisma schema:

- Generate the data model from [introspecting]() a database
- Manually writing the data model and mapping it to the database with [Prisma Migrate]()

Once the data model is defined, you can [generate Prisma Client]() which will expose CRUD and more queries for the defined models. If you're using TypeScript, you'll get full type-safety for all queries (even when only retrieving the subsets of a model's fields). 

### Accessing your database with Prisma Client

#### Generating Prisma Client

The first step when using Prisma Client is installing its npm package:

```
npm install @prisma/client
```

Note that the installation of this package invokes the `prisma generate` command which reads your Prisma schema and _generates_ the Prisma Client code. The code will be located in `node_modules/@prisma/client`. 

After you change your data model, you'll need to manually re-generate Prisma Client to ensure the code inside `node_modules/@prisma/client` get updated:

```
prisma generate
```

Note that cecause the Prisma Client node module contains specific context about _your_ Prisma schema, it's sometimes referred to as a ["smart node module"]().

#### Using Prisma Client to send queries to your database 

Once Prisma Client was generated, you can import in your code and send queries to your database. This is what the setup code looks like.

##### Import and instantiate Prisma Client

<CodeBlock languages={["import", "require"]}>

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')

const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

</CodeBlock>

Now you can start queries via the generated Prisma Client API, here are a few sample queries. Note that all Prisma Client queries return _plain old JavaScript objects_.

Learn more about the available operations in the [Prisma Client API reference]().

##### Retrieve all `User` records from the database

```ts
// Run inside `async` function
const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany()
```

##### Include the `posts` relation on each returned `User` object

```ts
// Run inside `async` function
const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany({
  include: { posts: true },
})
```

##### Filter all `Post` records that contain `"prisma"`

```ts
// Run inside `async` function
const filteredPosts = await prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      { title: { contains: "prisma" } },
      { content: { contains: "prisma" } },
    ],
  },
})
```

##### Create a new `User` and a new `Post` record in the same query

```ts
// Run inside `async` function
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@prisma.io",
    posts: {
      create: { title: "Join us for Prisma Day 2020" },
    },
  },
})
```

##### Update an existing `Post` record

```ts
// Run inside `async` function
const post = await prisma.post.update({
  where: { id: 42 },
  data: { published: true },
})
```

#### Usage with TypeScript

Note that when using TypeScript, the result of this query will be _statically typed_ so that you can't accidentally access a property that doesn't exist (and any typos are caught). Learn more about leveraging Prisma Client's generated types on the [Advanced usage of generated types]() page in the docs.

## Typical Prisma workflows

As mentioned above, there are two ways for "getting" your data model into the Prisma schema. Depending on which approach you choose, your main Prisma workflow might look different.

### SQL migrations and introspection

The typical workflow when using **SQL migrations and introspection** looks as follows:

1. Manually adjust your database schema using SQL
1. (Re-)introspect your database
1. (Re-)generate Prisma Client
1. Use Prisma Client in your application code to access your database

### Prisma Migrate

With **Prisma Migrate**, the workflow looks slightly different:

1. Manually adjust your [Prisma data model]()
1. Migrate your database using the `prisma migrate` CLI commands
1. (Re-)generate Prisma Client
1. Use Prisma Client in your application code to access your database
