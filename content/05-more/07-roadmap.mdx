## Overview

The roadmap reflects the _current plan_ for features that will be supported by Prisma in th future. The timeline for the listed features is non-committing since priorities might change and plans might need to be adjusted.

The roadmap will be updated monthly to reflect any changes in prioritization.

Note that the roadmap only lists "larger" features which require a significant engineering effort. For smaller features, please refer to the GitHub issues in the respective repo. You can get an overview of the features that are being worked in the current sprint by filtering for the `CURRENT-MILESTONE` label.

## What's next?

### Schema migrations with Prisma Migrate

[Prisma Migrate](../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-migrate) is a declarative database migration system. It lets you model your database via the Prisma schema and provides a CLI to map the Prisma schema to your database by generating the required SQL migration statements.

Prisma Migrate is already available as an experimental feature.

### JSON support

Some relational databases like PostgeSQL and MySQL have a `JSON` data type to store JSON text that follows the [RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159) spec.
