## What's next?

### Schema migrations with Prisma Migrate

[Prisma Migrate](../reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-migrate) is a declarative database migration system. It lets you model your database via the Prisma schema and provides a CLI to map the Prisma schema to your database by generating the required SQL migration statements.

Prisma Migrate is already available as an experimental feature.

### JSON support

Some relational databases like PostgeSQL and MySQL have a `JSON` data type to store JSON text that follows the [RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159) spec.
