## Overview

The data model definition part of the [Prisma schema](index) defines your application models (also called **Prisma models**). These models represent the entities of your _application domain_, map to the _tables_ in your database, and determine the shape of your Prisma Client API. 

The following schema represents the data model for a blogging platform:

```prisma
datasource postgresql {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

|model User {
| id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
| email   String   @unique
| name    String?
| role    Role     @default(USER)
| posts   Post[]
| profile Profile?
|}

|model Profile {
| id      Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
| bio     String
| user    User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
| userId  Int
|}

|model Post {
| id         Int         @id @default(autoincrement())
| createdAt  DateTime    @default(now())
| title      String
| published  Boolean     @default(false)
| author     User        @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
| authorId   Int
| categories Category[]  @relation(references: [id])
|}

|model Category {
| id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
| name  String
| posts Post[]  @relation(references: [id])
|}

|enum Role {
| USER
| ADMIN
|}
```

A data model is made up of:

- `model` primitives: Defines a [Prisma model](models)
- `enum` primitives: Defines an [enum](#enums) (only available if enums are supported natively by your database)
- [Attributes](#attributes) and [functions](#functions)

<ApiRef>

**API Reference:** [`model`](../../../api-reference/prisma-schema#model) and [`enum`](../../../api-reference/prisma-schema#enum)

</ApiRef>

The corresponding database looks like this:

![](prisma-schema/sample-database.png)

Your data model will reflect your application domain. "Typical" models include:

- In an **e-commerce** application you probably have models like `Customer`, `Order`, `Item` and `Invoice`.
- In a **social media** application you probably have models like `User`, `Post`, `Photo` and `Message`.


### Technical purpose of Prisma models

On a _technical_ level, models serve two main purposes:

- They represent the **tables** in the underlying database.
- They are the foundation for the available **queries** in the generated [Prisma Client API](../prisma-client/api).

When used with TypeScript, Prisma Client provides generated type definitions for your models and any [variations](../prisma-client/advanced-usage-of-generated-types) of them to make database access entirely type safe.

## Creating a data model

There are two ways to create a data model:

* Introspection
* Prisma Migrate

Depending on the use case, the data model is typically created in either of two ways:

- **Manually written**: You can write your data model manually and map it to your database using [Prisma Migrate](../prisma-migrate) (experimental). In this case, the data model is the single source of truth for the models of your application.
- **Generated from introspection**: When you have an existing database or prefer migrating your database schema with SQL, you generate the data model by [introspecting](../introspection) your database. In this case, the database schema is the single source of truth for the models of your application.

> **Note**: Since Prisma Migrate is currently in an experimental state, the officially recommended way for using Prisma is the introspection-based approach.

## Models

Models represent the entities of your application domain. They are defined using `model` blocks in the data model. In the [example data model](data-model#example), `User`, `Profile`, `Post` and `Category` are models. Here's the `User` model from the example for reference:

```prisma
model User {
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  email String @unique
  name String?
  role Role @default(USER)
  posts Post[]
  profile Profile?
}
```

On a technical level, a model maps to the underlying structures of the data source:

- In PostgreSQL, a model maps to a _table_
- In MySQL, a model maps to a _table_
- In SQLite, a model maps to a _table_

> **Note**: In the future there might be connectors for non-relational databases and other data sources. For example, for MongoDB a model would map to a _collection_, for a REST API it would map to a _resource_.

<ApiRef>

**API Reference:** [`model`](../../../api-reference/prisma-schema#model)

</ApiRef>

### Model names and table names

Prisma models naming conventions (singular form, PascalCase) do not always match table names in the database. A common approach for naming tables in databases is to use plural form and [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) notation - for example: `users`. When you introspect a database with a table named `users`, the result Prisma model will look like this:

```prisma
model users {
  id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  first_name  String
  // more fields ...
}
```

However, you can still adhere to the naming convention without renaming the underlying `users` table in the database by using the `@@map` attribute:

```prisma
model User {
  id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  first_name  String
  // more fields ...

  @@map(name: "users")
}
```

With this model definition, Prisma automatically maps the `User` model to the `users` table in the underlying database. Note that you can also map column names to field names using `@map`:

```prisma
model User {
  id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  firstName  String   @map(name: "first_name")
  // more fields ...

  @@map(name: "users")
}
```

`@@map` and `@map` are often used to [configure your Prisma Client API](../prisma-client/configuring-the-prisma-client-api) by decoupling it from the naming of tables and columns in the underlying database.

<ApiRef>

**API Reference:** [`@map`](../../../api-reference/prisma-schema#map) and [`@@map`](../../../api-reference/prisma-schema#map-1)

</ApiRef>

### Models in Prisma Client

#### Queries (CRUD)

Every model in the data model definition will result in a number of CRUD queries in the generated [Prisma Client API](../prisma-client/api):

- `findMany`
- `findOne`
- `create`
- `update`
- `upsert`
- `delete`
- `updateMany`
- `deleteMany`

The operations are accessible via a generated property on the Prisma Client instance. By default the name of the property is the lowercase form of the model name, e.g. `user` for a `User` model or `post` for a `Post` model.

Here is an example illustrating the use of a `user` property from the Prisma Client API:

```js
const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: 'Alice',
  },
})
const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany()
```

#### Type definitions

Prisma Client not only provides a query API for models, it also generates type definitions that reflect your model structures. These are part of the generated [`@prisma/client`](../prisma-client/generating-prisma-client#the-prismaclient-npm-package) node module in a file called `index.d.ts`.

When using TypeScript, these type definitions ensure that all your database queries are entirely type safe and validated at compile-time (even partial queries using [`select`](../prisma-client/field-selection#select) or [`include`](../prisma-client/field-selection#include)).

Even when using plain JavaScript, the type definitions are still included in the `@prisma/client` node module, enabling features like [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense)/autocompletion in your editor.

> **Note**: The actual types are stored in the `.prisma/client` folder. `@prisma/client/index.d.ts` exports the contents of this folder.

For example, the type definition for the `User` model from above would look as follows:

```ts
export type User = {
  id: number
  email: string
  name: string | null
  role: string
}
```

Note that the relation fields `posts` and `profile` are not included in the type definition by default. However, if you need variations of the `User` type you can still define them using some of [Prisma Client's generated helper types](../prisma-client/generating-prisma-client) (in this case, these helper types would be called `UserGetIncludePayload` and `UserGetSelectPayload`).

## Fields

The properties of a model are called _fields_. Fields map to _columns_ and consist of several parts:

- [Type](#field-types)
- [Type modifier](#type-modifiers) (optional)
- [Attributes](data-model#attributes) (optional)

Here's an overview of these for the fields from the `User` model [above](models#overview:

| Name        | Type       | Scalar vs Relation | Type modifier | Attributes                            |
| :---------- | :--------- | :----------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------ |
| `id`        | `Int`      | Scalar             | -             | `@id` and `@default(autoincrement())` |
| `createdAt` | `DateTime` | Scalar             | -             | `@default(now())`                     |
| `email`     | `String`   | Scalar             | -             | `@unique`                             |
| `name`      | `String`   | Scalar             | `?`           | -                                     |
| `role`      | `Role`     | Scalar (enum)      | -             | `@default(USER)`                      |
| `posts`     | `Post`     | Relation (virtual) | `?`           | -                                     |
| `profile`   | `Profile`  | Relation (virtual) | `[]`          | -                                     |

### Field types

The type of a field determines its _structure_. A type falls in either of two categories:

- [Scalar type](data-model#scalar-types) (includes [enums](data-model#enums)) - for example, `String` or `Int`.
- Model (the field is then called [relation field](relations#relation-fields)) - for example `Post[]` or `Profile`.

### Type modifiers

The type of a field can be modified by appending either of two modifiers:

- `[]`: Make a field a **list**
- `?`: Make a field **optional**

The `User` model has a `Post[]` list field and an optional `Profie?` field:

```prisma
model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  role    Role     @default(USER)
| posts   Post[]
| profile Profile?
}
```

> **Note**: Scalar lists (arrays) are only supported in the data model if your database natively supports them. Currently, scalar lists are therefore only supported when using PostgreSQL (since MySQL and SQLite don't natively support scalar lists).

<ApiRef>

**API Reference:** [Type modifiers](../../../api-reference/prisma-schema#model-field-type-modifiers)

</ApiRef>

### Required fields

When **not** annotating a field with the `?` type modifier, the field will be _required_ on every record of the model. This has effects on two levels:

- **Database**: Required fields are represented via `NOT NULL` constraints in the underlying database.
- **Prisma Client**: Prisma Client's generated [TypeScript types](#type-definitions) that represent the models in your application code will also define these fields as required to ensure they always carry values at runtime.

## Attributes

<ApiRef>

**API Reference**: [Attributes](../../../api-reference/prisma-schema#attributes)

</ApiRef>

### IDs

An ID uniquely identifies individual records of a model. IDs can be defined by a single field using the `@id` attribute, or multiple fields using the `@@id` attribute.

In the following example, the `User` ID is represented by the `id` field:

```prisma
model User {
| id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email   String   @unique
  name    String?
  role    Role     @default(USER)
  posts   Post[]
  profile Profile?
}
```

In the following example, the `User` ID is represented by a combination of the `firstName` and `lastName` fields:

```prisma
model User {
  firstName String
  lastName  String
  email     String @unique
  isAdmin   Boolean @default(false)

| @@id([firstName, lastName])
}
```

> **Note**: A model can only have _one_ ID, and that ID can either be a single field or based on multiple fields.


<ApiRef>

**API Reference:** [`@id`]() and [`@@id`]()

</ApiRef>

### Unique values

You can add unique attributes to your models to be able to uniquely identify individual records of that model. Unique attributes can be defined on a single field using `@unique` attribute, or on multiple fields (also called composite or compound unique constraints) using the `@@unique` attribute.

In the following example, the value of the `email` field must be unique:

```prisma
model User {
| email String  @unique // `email` can not be optional because it's the only unique field on the model
  name  String?
}
```

In the following example, a combination of `authorId` and `title` must be unique:

```prisma
model Post {
  id         Int         @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt  DateTime    @default(now())
  title      String
  published  Boolean     @default(false)
  author     User        @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId   Int
  categories Category[]  @relation(references: [id])

| @@unique([authorId, title])
}
```

  See <a>API Reference: @unique and @@unique</a>
</div>

### Default values

You can define default values for scalar fields of your models using the `@default` attribute:

```prisma
model Post {
  id         Int         @id @default(autoincrement())
| createdAt  DateTime    @default(now())
  title      String
| published  Boolean     @default(false)
  author     User        @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId   Int
  categories Category[]  @relation(references: [id])
}
```

Default values can be:

- Static values that correspond to the field type, such as `5` (`Int`), `Hello` (`String`), or `false` (`Boolean`)
- Functions, such as `now()` or `uuid()`

<ApiRef>

**API Reference:** [`@default`]() and [`attribute functions`]()

</ApiRef>


### Indexes

You can define indexes on one or multiple fields of your models via the `@@index` on a model.

<div style="border-radius:8px;background-color: rgb(246, 248, 250); background-image: url(https://cdn.onlinewebfonts.com/svg/img_285835.png);background-size:30px;background-position: 20px 20px;background-repeat:no-repeat; padding:20px 10px 10px 70px;min-height: 70px">
  See <a>API Reference: Indexes</a>
</div>

### Mapping column, table and `enum` names

You can use the `@map` and `@@map` attributes to map field, model and enum names as well in your Prisma schema to different column and table names in the underlying database schema.

Read more about this on the [Configuring the Prisma Client API](../prisma-client/configuring-the-prisma-client-api) page.

<div style="border-radius:8px;background-color: rgb(246, 248, 250); background-image: url(https://cdn.onlinewebfonts.com/svg/img_285835.png);background-size:30px;background-position: 20px 20px;background-repeat:no-repeat; padding:20px 10px 10px 70px;min-height: 70px">
  See <a>API Reference: @map and @@map</a>
</div>

### Relations

You can learn everything about configuration relations on the [Relations](relations) page in the docs.

## Enums

You can define enums in your data model if they're supported by the [data source](data-sources) you use:

- PostgreSQL: [Supported](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/datatype-enum.html)
- MySQL: [Supported](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/enum.html)
- SQLite: Not supported

Enums are considered [scalar](#scalar-types) types in the Prisma data model. They're therefore [by default](../prisma-client/field-selection#the-default-selection-set) included as return values in [Prisma Client queries](../prisma-client/crud).

Enums are defined via the `enum` block.

## Functions

The Prisma schema supports a number of functions. These can be used to specify [default values](#default-values) on fields of a model. You can find a reference for all available functions [here](#functions-as-default-values).
