## Overview

The Prisma 2 CLI is available as an [npm package](). It is **recommended to install the Prisma 2 CLI locally** in your project's `package.json` to avoid version conflicts.

## Local installation (recommended)

The Prisma 2 CLI is typically installed as a **development dependency**, that's why the `--save-dev` (npm) and `--dev` (Yarn) options are used in the commands below.

#### npm

Install with npm:

```
npm install prisma2 --save-dev
```

This should add `prisma2` to the `devDependencies` in your `package.json`. You can then invoke the locally installed `prisma2` CLI by prefixing it with [`npx`](https://github.com/npm/npx#readme):

```
npx prisma2
```

Here's an example for invoking the `generate` command:

```
npx prisma2 generate
```

#### Yarn

Install with Yarn:

```
yarn add prisma2 dev
```

This should add `prisma2` to the `devDependencies` in your `package.json`. You can then invoke the locally installed `prisma2` CLI by prefixing it with `yarn`:

```
yarn prisma2
```

Here's an example for invoking the `generate` command:

```
yarn prisma2 generate
```

## Global installation

While it is recommended to [locally install](#local-installation-recommended) the `prisma2` CLI, you can also install it globally on your machine.

> **Warning**: If you have several Prisma projects on your machine, a global installation can lead to version conflicts between these projects.

#### npm

Install with npm:

```
npm install -g prisma2
```

You can then invoke the globally installed `prisma2` CLI like so:

```
prisma2
```

Here's an example for invoking the `generate` command:

```
prisma2 generate
```

#### Yarn

Install with Yarn:

```
yarn global add prisma2
```

You can then invoke the globally installed `prisma2` CLI like so:

```
prisma2
```

Here's an example for invoking the `generate` command:

```
prisma2 generate
```
