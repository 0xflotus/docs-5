## Overview

You can introspect your database using the Prisma CLI in order to generate the [data model]() in your [Prisma schema](). The data model is needed to [generate Prisma Client]().

Introspection is often used to generate an _initial_ version of the data model when [adding Prisma to an existing project](). However, it can also be used _repeatedly_ in an application. This is most commonly the case when you're _not_ using [Prisma Migrate]() but perform schema migrations using plain SQL or another migration tool. In that case, you also need to re-introspect your database and subsequently re-generate Prisma Client to reflect the schema changes in your [Prisma Client API](). 

## What does introspection do?

Introspection has one main goal: Populate your Prisma schema with a data model that reflects the current database schema.

Here's an overview of its main functions:

- Map _tables_ in the database to [Prisma models]()
- Map _columns_ in the database to the [fields]() of Prisma models
- Map _indexes_ in the database to [indexes]() in the Prisma schema
- Map _database_ constraints to corresponding [attributes]() in the Prisma schema

## The `prisma introspect` command

You can introspect your database using the `prisma introspect` command of the [Prisma CLI](). Note that using this command requires your [connection URL]() to be set in your Prisma schema!

> **Warning**: The `prisma introspect` command overwrites the current version of your Prisma schema! If you made any manual adjustments to the Prisma schema (e.g. by adding [comments](), [making a 1-1-relation required on both sides]() or [configuring your Prisma Client API]()), be sure to back up your schema before running the command!

Here's a high-level overview of the steps that `prisma introspect` performs internally:

1. Read the [connection URL]() from the `datasource` configuration in the Prisma schema
1. Open database connection
1. Introspect database schema (i.e. read tables, columns and other structures ...)
1. Transform database schema into Prisma data model
1. Write data model into Prisma schema

## Rules and conventions

Prisma employs a number of conventions for translating a database schema into a Prisma data model:

- Field, model and enum names (identifiers) must start with a letter and generally must only contain underscores, letters and digits.
- If invalid characters appear before a letter in an identifier, they get dropped. If they appear after the initial letter, they are replaced by an underscorce. Additionally, the transformed name is mapped to the database using `@map` or `@@map` to retain the original name.
- If sanitization results in duplicate identifiers, no immediate error handling is in place. You get the error later and can manually fix it.
- Relation names for a relation between models `A` and `B` are generated as `AToB` (the model that comes first in alphabetical order also appears first in the generated relation name). If relation names turn out to be ambiguous because there is more than one relation between models `A` and `B`, the field name of the column that holds the foreign key is appended to the model name after an underscore to disambiguate, e.g.: `A_FieldWithFKToB`. 
- The name of the virtual relation field is based on the opposing model. It gets camel cases by defauld and pluralized (unless the column with the foreign key also has a unique constraint). If back-relation fields are ambiguous, the relation name is appended to disambiguate.

## Introspecting only a subset of your database schema

Introspecting only a subset of your database schema is [not yet officially supported](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/issues/807) by Prisma. 

However, you can achieve this by creating a new database user that only has access to the tables which you'd like to see represented in your Prisma schema, and then perform the introspection using that user. The introspection will then only include the tables the new user has access to.
