## Overview

You can introspect your database using the Prisma CLI in order to generate the [data model]() in your [Prisma schema](). The data model is needed to [generate Prisma Client]().

Introspection is often used to generate an _initial_ version of the data model when [adding Prisma to an existing project](). However, it can also be used _repeatedly_ in an application. This is most commonly the case when you're _not_ using [Prisma Migrate]() but perform schema migrations using plain SQL or another migration tool. In that case, you also need to re-introspect your database and subsequently re-generate Prisma Client to reflect the schema changes in your [Prisma Client API]().

## What does introspection do?

Introspection has one main goal: Populate your Prisma schema with a data model that reflects the current database schema.

Here's an overview of its main functions:

- Map _tables_ in the database to [Prisma models]()
- Map _columns_ in the database to the [fields]() of Prisma models
- Map _indexes_ in the database to [indexes]() in the Prisma schema
- Map _database_ constraints to corresponding [attributes]() in the Prisma schema


## The `prisma introspect` command

You can introspect your database using the `prisma introspect` command of the [Prisma CLI]().


> **Warning**: The `prisma introspect` command overwrites the current version of your Prisma schema! If you made any manual adjustments to the Prisma schema (e.g. by adding [comments](), [making a 1-1-relation required on both sides]() or [configuring your Prisma Client API]()), be sure to back up your schema before running the command!


Here's a high-level overview of the steps that `prisma introspect` performs internally:

1. Read the [connection URL]() from the `datasource` configuration in the Prisma schema
1. Open database connection
1. Introspect database schema (i.e. read tables, columns and other structures ...)
1. Transform database schema into Prisma data model
1. Write data model into Prisma schema
