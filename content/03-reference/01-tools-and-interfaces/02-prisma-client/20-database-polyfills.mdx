## Overview

Prisma Client provides features that are typically not achievable with relational databases. These features are referred to as _polyfills_.

- Initializing [ID]() values with `cuid` and `uuid` values
- Using [`@updatedAt`]() to store the time when a record was last updated
- [Making 1-1-relations required on both sides]()
- [Implicit many-to-many relations]()
