## Overview

Prisma needs a connection URL to be able to connect to your database, e.g. when sending queries with [Prisma Client]() or when changing the database schema with [Prisma Migrate]().

The connection URL is provided via the `url` field of a `datasource` block in your Prisma schema. It generally consists of the following components (except for SQLite):

- **User**: The name of your database user
- **Password**: The password for your database user
- **Host**: The IP or domain name of the machine where your database server is running
- **Port**: The port on which your database server is running
- **Database name**: The name of the database you want to use

Make sure you have this information at hand when getting started with Prisma. If you don't have a database server running yet, you can either use a local SQLite database file (see the [Quickstart]()) or [setup a free PostgreSQL database on Heroku](https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1).

Here is an example for a local PostgreSQL database:

```prisma
dataource postgresql {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb"
}
```

## Format

The format of the connection URL depends on the _database connector_ you're using. Prisma supports the standard formats for each database.
