## Overview

This page explains how to get started with Prisma in five minutes. You will learn how to send queries to a SQL database in a plain Node.js script using Prisma Client.

For the demo purposes of this guide, you will use a local [SQLite]() database file. If you're looking to set up Prisma with your own database, you have these options:

- [Add Prisma to an existing project]()
- [Setup Prisma from scratch with your own database]()


## 1. Download starter project & install dependencies

This guide comes with a small starter project that already has Prisma configured against a SQLite database file. 

Open your terminal and download the starter project with the following command:

```
curl ...
```

<br />
<details><summary>Expand for more info on the starter project</summary>

The starter project consists of five files:

- `package.json`: Defines your npm dependencies
- `prisma/schema.prisma`: Prisma configuration file defining your [models]() 
- `prisma/.env`: Defines your database connection URL as an environment variable
- `prisma/dev.db`: A SQLite database file
- `scr/index.js`: A plain, executable Node.js script

Note that the only two dependencies defined in your project are:

- `@prisma/cli`: The Prisma CLI which you can invoke with `npx prisma`
- `@prisma/client`: Prisma Client library for accessing your database


</details>

Befor you move on, installl the npm dependencies with this command:

```
npm install
```

## 2. Writing your first query with Prisma Client

The code inside `src/index.js` currently looks as follows:

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  // ... you will write your Prisma Client queries here
}

main()
  .catch(e => {
    throw e
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.disconnect()
  })
```



<br />
<details><summary>Expand for an explanation of the script</summary>

Here's a quick overview of the main parts:

1. Import the `PrismaClient` constructor from the `@prisma/client` node module
1. Instantiate `PrismaClient` 
1. Define an `async` function called `main` to send queries to the database
1. Call the `main` function
1. Close the database connections when the script terminates
