## Overview

**Note: The content of this page is temporary and will be updated soon.**

This page explains how to get started with Prisma in an existing project. 

If you don't have a database to try Prisma or just want to explore everything from scratch, check out the ready-to-run [example projects](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/) with use cases for REST, GraphQL, gRPC and more.

## Add Prisma to an existing project

Follow these steps to use Prisma in an existing application with a database. Note that these steps assume that you have an existing Node.js or TypeScript project (in case you don't, follow the [extended guide](#extended-guide) below):

1. Install `prisma2` as a development dependency: `npm install prisma2 --save-dev`
1. Run `npx prisma2 init` to create an empty [Prisma schema]()
1. Set the `url` of the `datasource` block in the Prisma schema to your database connection URL
1. Run `prisma2 introspect` to obtain your data model from the database schema
1. Run `npm install @prisma/client` to add the Prisma Client npm package to your project
1. Run `prisma2 generate` to generate Prisma Client
1. Import Prisma Client into your code: `import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'`
1. Instantiate Prisma Client: `const prisma = new PrismaClient()`
1. Use Prisma Client in code (use your editor's auto-completion to explore its API)

> **Note**: If Prisma's introspection failed for your database schema, please [open an issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/issues/new) and tell us what went wrong. If you want to help us make Prisma more resilient, please [share your database SQL schema with us](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/issues/757) so we can add it to our introspection testing suite.
